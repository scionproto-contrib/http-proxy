SCION HTTP Proxy
================

This repository contains technical documentation for the SCION HTTP Proxy.
The source code for the SCION HTTP Proxy can be found on https://github.com/scionproto-contrib/http-proxy.
We instantiate the SCION HTTP Proxy using the caddy plugins, which are available at `Caddy SCION <https://github.com/scionproto-contrib/caddy-scion>`_.

This site contains documentation for setting up the SCION HTTP Proxy in both Forward and Reverse Proxy modes:
   - :doc:`Forward Proxy <forward-proxy>`
   - :doc:`Reverse Proxy <reverse-proxy>`

If you are here as a developer and want to contribute to the implementation, please refer to the :doc:`Development Setup <dev_setup>` documentation.

If you are a browser user, you may be interested in the `SCION Browser Extension <https://scion-browser-extension.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ documentation.

The SCION HTTP Proxy is part of a broader group of `SCION Applications <https://docs.scion.org/projects/scion-applications/en/latest>`_.
